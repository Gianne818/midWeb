      <h2>Why I chose to study BSCS</h2>
      <p>I have been passionate on technology. On 12th grade, I was given the privilege to do lead two IoT projects
          and found that I really liked working with them. However, as per much of my research, my initial choice of computer engineering
          does not earn as high of a salary as computer science graduates. So I decided to go for computer science, since my I am quite
          clumsy, not suitable for handling hardwares, and I like doing maths, which is what the science of computing is all about.

    <h2>The Three Most Influential People in My Life</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>My Mother</b> - She is the person who raised me, since my father was away for work when I was young. She is the one who helped educate me.</li>
        <li><b>My Father</b> - Although he was away when I was young, he was still the one who disciplined me the most, especially when I did something wrong. But he still is a loving father.</li>
        <li><b>My Significant Other</b> - This may sound cheesy or corny, but she influenced a lot of my behaviors. From how I treated my parents better, to being closer to god, and having better self-care.</li>
